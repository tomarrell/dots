# Dots :scroll:
Personally written &amp; maintained custom dotfiles surrounding my Emacs setup.

This is more experimental and subject to quite drastic changes. Check out my [tools repo](https://github.com/tomarrell/tools) if you're looking for what I use on a daily basis inside NVim.

## Why?
I use Neovim day-to-day, however I like a few of the tools that were born out of Emacs land. This is essentially what I use to evaluate them and see if I should incorporate them into my workflow.
