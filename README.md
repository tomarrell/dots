# Dots :scroll:

Personally written &amp; maintained custom dotfiles surrounding my Emacs setup.

This is more experimental and subject to quite drastic changes. Check out my [tools repo](https://github.com/tomarrell/tools) if you're looking for what I use on a daily basis inside NVim.

## Why?

I use Neovim day-to-day, however I like a few of the tools that were born out of Emacs land. This is essentially what I use to evaluate them and see if I should incorporate them into my workflow.

## Installation

Make sure to install `pandoc` if you would like to do any sort of Markdown exporting.

Just clone the repo to `~/.emacs.d`.

```bash
> brew install pandoc # optional if you want markdown export/preview
> mv ~/.emacs.d ~/emacs.d.ol
> git clone https://github.com/tomarrell/dots ~/.emacs.d
```
